Data Administration Concepts &amp; Management
This was a project inside of SQL. Unfortunately the project remains incomplete because of a multitude of factors, many
of which were outside of my control. The premise was to create a database based on the tik tok show "can it Kirkland"
where the hosts try to figure out if they can discern name brand alcohol from its Costco counterpart. As the database
beginnings were created by me, there is no dataset link.
